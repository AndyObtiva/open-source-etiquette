# Open-Source Etiquette

(work in progress)

- If you receive an issue, evaluate if it is serious first, and if so, do not respond or close it until it is fully addressed (unless you add to another issue). Closing the issue becomes a motivation to work on it and fully address it. Do not waste that opportunity if it is a serious issue, and definitely avoid making promises if you did not work on the issue or close it. Remember that actions speak louder than words!
- Make commits to incomplete open-source projects (ones that have not had v1.0 released yet) every other month at minimum, but preferably once per week 
- When reporting an issue, provide a step-by-step scenario for reproducing the issue if it is easy to reproduce, and follow troubleshooting instructions that project owners might give you to help you troubleshoot the issue further.
- Do not open an issue when the effort to implement a fix or a feature is so small. Open a pull request instead. 
- Do not talk too much without taking action. Make sure to only talk the talk when you also walk the walk. Think of action as the currency that makes it possible for you to talk. If you don't have action, you can't talk. This acts as a motivation to do more in open-source projects and produce, which is the most important thing anyways, instead of just wasting a lot of time talking or making big promises that become back-breaking to meet. Instead, take small actions that deliver small results, talk only a little bit if you want, and then take more small actions to deliver more small results. That way, you never fall for the trap of making promises so big you can never meet or that discourage you from action with their huge size.
- Never put pressure on an open-source project's author if he is unavailable or too busy as that comes across as disrespectful and might discourage them from becoming available. There is never a need to sweat an author's lack of availability with open-source projects. The whole point of open-source is anybody can clone the code and make future changes themselves in a fork if the project's author becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable. And, Pull Requests make it possible to eventually merge the fork back in if the author does become available again.
