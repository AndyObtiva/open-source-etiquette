# Open-Source Etiquette

As an Open-Source Project Author:

- Always make frequent small releases instead of big ones to avoid falling for the trap of getting stuck with a huge blob of features that never feel "perfect" enough to release. I know many open-source projects that died that way. Do not let yours die that way too!
- Make commits to incomplete open-source projects (ones that have not had version 1.0 yet) every other month at minimum, and preferably once per week.
- If you receive an issue, evaluate if it is serious first, and if it is, do not respond or close until you do the work to fully address it (unless you add it to another issue or attribute its cause to another project). Closing the issue becomes a motivation to work on it and fully address it. Do not waste that opportunity if it is a serious issue, and definitely avoid making promises if you did not work on the issue yet. Remember that actions speak louder than words!
- Do not talk (i.e. comment or chat) too much without taking action. Make sure to only talk the talk when you also walk the walk. Think of action as the currency that makes it possible for you to talk. If you have not taken any action yet, you cannot talk. This acts as a motivation to do more in open-source projects and produce, which is the most important goal, instead of just wasting a lot of time talking or making big promises that become back-breaking to meet. Instead, take small actions that deliver small results, talk only a little bit afterwards if you want, and then take more small actions to deliver more small results. That way, you never fall for the trap of making promises so big you can never meet or that discourage you from action in the future.
- If you fail to meet a promise you made to someone or a deadline you agreed to, do not just apologize without doing anything to make up for your failure as that will come across as empty meaningless words, thus making matters even worse! Instead, silently work as hard and fast as you can on finishing the promised output that you are delayed with and only respond with an apology once you have something fully finished that would redeem you.

As an Open-Source Project User:

- Never put pressure on an open-source project's author if he is unavailable or too busy as that comes across as disrespectful and might discourage them from becoming available. There is never a need to sweat an author's lack of availability with open-source projects. The whole point of open-source is anybody can clone the code and make future changes themselves in a fork if the project's author becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable. And, Pull Requests make it possible to eventually merge the fork back in if the author does become available again. Furthermore, this can be an opportunity to learn a new codebase and improve your software engineering skills. Do not waste it by whining about an author's lack of availability.
- Do not open an issue when the effort to implement a fix or a feature is so small. Open a pull request instead. Remember that open-source projects are a community effort. Finding a small issue or feature that is quick to implement is your opportunity to make a contribution!
- When reporting an issue, provide a step-by-step scenario for reproducing the issue if it is easy to reproduce, and follow troubleshooting instructions that project owners might give you to help you troubleshoot the issue further.
