# Open-Source Etiquette

As Open-Source Project Author:

- Always make frequent small releases instead of big ones to avoid falling for the trap of getting stuck with a huge blob of features that never feel "perfect" enough to release. I know many open-source projects that died that way. Do not let yours die that way too!
- Make commits to incomplete open-source projects (ones that have not had version 1.0 yet) every other month at minimum, and preferably once per week.
- If you receive an issue, evaluate if it is serious first, and if it is, do not respond or close until it is fully addressed (unless you add to another issue). Closing the issue becomes a motivation to work on it and fully address it. Do not waste that opportunity if it is a serious issue, and definitely avoid making promises if you did not work on the issue yet. Remember that actions speak louder than words!
- Do not talk (i.e. comment or chat) too much without taking action. Make sure to only talk the talk when you also walk the walk. Think of action as the currency that makes it possible for you to talk. If you have not taken any action yet, you cannot talk. This acts as a motivation to do more in open-source projects and produce, which is the most important goal, instead of just wasting a lot of time talking or making big promises that become back-breaking to meet. Instead, take small actions that deliver small results, talk only a little bit afterwards if you want, and then take more small actions to deliver more small results. That way, you never fall for the trap of making promises so big you can never meet or that discourage you from action in the future.

As Open-Source Project User:

- Do not open an issue when the effort to implement a fix or a feature is so small. Open a pull request instead. 
- Never put pressure on an open-source project's author if he is unavailable or too busy as that comes across as disrespectful and might discourage them from becoming available. There is never a need to sweat an author's lack of availability with open-source projects. The whole point of open-source is anybody can clone the code and make future changes themselves in a fork if the project's author becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable. And, Pull Requests make it possible to eventually merge the fork back in if the author does become available again. Furthermore, this can be an opportunity to learn a new codebase and improve your software engineering skills. Do not waste it by whining about an author's lack of availability.
- When reporting an issue, provide a step-by-step scenario for reproducing the issue if it is easy to reproduce, and follow troubleshooting instructions that project owners might give you to help you troubleshoot the issue further.
