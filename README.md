# Open-Source Etiquette

**Open-source project authors:**

- Always make frequent small releases instead of big ones to avoid falling for the trap of getting stuck with a huge blob of features that never feel "perfect" enough to release. I know many open-source projects that died that way. Do not let yours die that way too!
- Make commits to incomplete open-source projects (ones that have not had version 1.0 yet) every other month at minimum, and preferably once per week.
- If you receive an issue, evaluate if it is serious first, and if it is, do not respond or close until you do the work to fully address it (unless you add it to another issue or attribute its cause to another project). Closing the issue becomes a motivation to work on it and fully address it. Do not waste that opportunity if it is a serious issue, and definitely avoid making promises if you did not work on the issue yet. Remember that actions speak louder than words!
- Do not talk (i.e. comment or chat) too much without taking action. Make sure to only talk the talk when you also walk the walk. Think of action as the currency that makes it possible for you to talk. If you have not taken any action yet, you cannot talk. This acts as a motivation to do more in open-source projects and produce, which is the most important goal, instead of just wasting a lot of time talking or making big promises that become back-breaking to meet. Instead, take small actions that deliver small results, talk only a little bit afterwards if you want, and then take more small actions to deliver more small results. That way, you never fall for the trap of making promises so big you can never meet or that discourage you from action in the future.
- If you fail to meet a promise you made to someone or a deadline you agreed to, do not just apologize without doing anything to make up for your failure as that will come across as empty words that make matters even worse! Instead, silently work as hard and as fast as you can on finishing the promised output that you are delayed with and only respond with an apology once you have something fully finished that would redeem you.
- Always ground your open-source project in a real world application (app samples do count) to ensure you are eating your own dog food, thus understanding how software engineers truly use your project to provide more realistic support for features and tuning of the software architecture (e.g. performance, security, maintainability, etc...)
- Avoid over-engineering your open-source project by not attempting to handle every case imaginable. Instead, as per the bullet point about grounding your project in real world applications, just make sure to handle every case needed in a real world scenario, and leave any future ideas till they are actually needed. When engineering solutions in your projects, always keep the YAGNI rule in mind (Ya Ain't Gonna Need It) to filter out any unnecessary dead-code features.
- Always ensure the best software architecture and software design while only keeping today's requirements in mind and applying the YAGNI rule on future requirements. Refactor your open-source project code often to always ensure it has the best structure given today's requirements.
- Always provide examples (aka samples) of how to use your open-source projects. 
- Documentation is optional in open-source projects because software engineers can always read the source code directly to understand how it works, assuming it is well-architectued, well-designed, well-factored. However, putting the effort into providing documentation greatly increases the popularity of an open-source project, so when possible, do your best to document your open-source projects.
- Never take sincere feedback defensively. Remember that if someone gives you feedback, it does not mean they think you are lacking in software engineering skills, yet it means they are interested enough in your project to do you the great favor of providing feedback that helps your project improve. Any feedback is pure gold that you must not let go to waste by rejecting, yet you should use as fuel to iron out the rough edges of your project. Rejecting feedback is always considered a sign of mediocrity. In fact, the irony is that rejecting feedback is what would tell others that you are lacking in software engineering skills, not the inverse.

**Open-source project users:**

- Never put pressure on an open-source project's author if he is unavailable or too busy as that comes across as disrespectful and might discourage them from becoming available. There is never a need to sweat an author's lack of availability with open-source projects. The whole point of open-source is anybody can clone the code and make future changes themselves in a fork if the project's author becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable. And, Pull Requests make it possible to eventually merge the fork back in if the author does become available again. Furthermore, this can be an opportunity to learn a new codebase and improve your software engineering skills. Do not waste it by whining about an author's lack of availability.
- Do not open an issue when the effort to implement a fix or a feature is so small. Open a pull request instead. Remember that open-source projects are a community effort. Finding a small issue or feature that is quick to implement is your opportunity to make a contribution!
- When reporting an issue, provide a step-by-step scenario for reproducing the issue if it is easy to reproduce, and follow troubleshooting instructions that project owners might give you to help you troubleshoot the issue further.

**Everyone:**

- Software engineers with less skill and experience must always be humble enough to defer to software engineers with more skill and experience in order to enable the best work possible to happen. After all, if newbie snowboarders encounter Shaun White on the snow mountain, they will obviously follow in his footsteps to learn the best snowboarding tricks, not the other way around. That said, deferring to a more skilled and experienced software engineer does not mean treating them as infallible. Everyone makes mistakes, so it is OK to point out error and challenge solutions, but that must be done respectfully (in deference) and with good intentions (not out of childish spite).
